This directory contains the TSV and related files of the foodweb-baywet network: This network contains the carbon exchanges in the cypress wetlands of South Florida during the wet season. Nodes represent taxa and an an edge denotes that a taxon uses another taxon as food with a given trophic factor (feeding level).

    meta.foodweb-baywet -- Metadata about the network 
    out.foodweb-baywet -- The adjacency matrix of the network in whitespace-separated values format, with one edge per line
      The meaning of the columns in out.foodweb-baywet are: 
        First column: ID of from node 
        Second column: ID of to node
        Third column (if present): weight or multiplicity of edge
        Fourth column (if present):  timestamp of edges Unix time
        Third column: edge weight
