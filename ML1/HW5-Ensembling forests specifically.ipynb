In the ```__init__(self, parameters)``` function, you will set the parameters (number of trees, percentage of instances to use for each tree, random_seed, ...), initialize (diverse in terms of max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf, and **max_features**) trees and store them in a member attribute (a Python _list_ called ```self.base_classifiers```).\n",

    "In scikit-learn's decision tree implementation, the ```max_features``` parameter determines the maximum number of features considered for splitting a node. If set to an integer value, it considers that exact number of features. Alternatively, if set to a float between 0 and 1, it represents a fraction of total features. For example, max_features=0.5 means the algorithm will consider half of the features. More details: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html\n",

    "Notes about object-oriented programming: \n",
    " - The whole Python _class_ (all the member functions, i.e. methods) need to be implemented in one Jupyter notebook cell.\n",
    " - ```self``` in front of variable names (or as a first parameter in functions) inside a class makes the variable (function) a member attribute (method). The members are accessible to other class members, i.e. if you define ```self.base_classifiers``` within the constructor (```__init__```), you can access it within ```fit``` and ```predict```.\n",

    "Here we create a class that ensembles a forest of decision trees, building on the DecisionTreeClassifier class, combining multiple instances of diverse trees, with a \"voting system\" to decide the final class. I also implemented a probabilistic classifier, that gives back the probability of each class, based on the results from the trees. I tried to make it \"stable\" on randomness by setting a random seed, however, it weirdly only becomes stable after running the \"test the results\" function 3 times, from that point on we always get the same results. (See the printed \"random seeds\". )\n",
    "\n",
    "Results: The majority class does only 40% well, which is understandable, as the test set is distributed in 15:18:12 and class (1) is most popular, it is correct only 18/(15+18+12)=40% of the times. The decision tree and forest ensembler do similarly well, they are mostly 93.333-95.555% good (with other seeds, the ensembler does 95.55% well most commonly). Test set has 45 elements, so 2 mistakes result in 95.55% accuracy, 3 mistakes results in 93.33% accuracy. While the decision tree varied in results between 91.11%-100% (different seeds), it's quite \"unreliable\", the ensembler is much more stable. I didn't get any other result than 93.33% or 95.55% for the ensembler. In fact, there were only 4 data points in the test set that ever got \"failed\" by the assembler: index 2 and 9, which are consistently failed, occasionally index 11 too, and rarely index 44. This also shows that it is much more consistent. "
